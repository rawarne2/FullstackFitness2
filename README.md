This was my first solo project and first introduction to React Native. I have learned a lot of lessons while creating this project. For example, create react components in Presentational and Container components (smart and dumb components). Also, add redux at the beginning. It can be a lot of effort changing how state is manipulated after a project gets too big. Lastly, make a style sheet from the start. It will always be necessary to do over inline styling. I tried to fix some of the issues but I have decided to work on other projects instead.
